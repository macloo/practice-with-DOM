<h1>Practice with JavaScript and the DOM</h1>

<p>Open the JavaScript Console in Chrome. Practice using the following JavaScript methods with the elements on this page. Access HTML elements by their class, ID or tag.</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>document.getElementById( );</code></li>
	<li><code>document.getElementsByClassName( );</code></li>
	<li><code>document.getElementsByTagName( );</code></li>
	<li><code><em>someImage</em>.getAttribute( );</code></li>
	<li><code><em>someImage</em>.setAttribute( );</code></li>
</ul>

<p>At the <em>bottom</em> of this page, you'll find examples showing how you can practice in the JavaScript Console.</p>

<h2>The story of Sita</h2>

<img id="Sita" class="people" src="images/sita.jpg" alt="Sita">

	<p>Ravana carries Sita away to Lanka, where Sita is kept under the heavy guard of rakshasis. Ravana demands Sita marry him, but Sita, <span class="special">eternally devoted to Rama</span>, refuses. Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction, and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet the demon Kabandha and the ascetic Shabari, who direct them towards Sugriva, the monkey king, and Hanuman.</p>

	<h2>The story of Rama and his brother</h2>

	<img id="Rama" class="people" src="images/rama.jpg" alt="Rama">

	<img id="Lakshmana" class="people" src="images/lakshmana.jpg" alt="Lakshmana">

	<p>Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, held prisoner in Lanka, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother Vibhishana. The monkeys construct <span class="special">a giant floating bridge across the ocean</span>, and the princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy battle ensues, in which Rama eventually kills Ravana.</p>

	<h2>The story of Hanuman</h2>

	<img id="Hanuman" class="people" src="images/hanuman.jpg" alt="Hanuman">

	<p>After learning about Sita's abduction, Hanuman assumes a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way he meets with many challenges, including <span class="special">a fight with a demon</span>. He spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, reassures her, and gives her Rama's signet ring as a token of faith.</p>

<h2>Four Examples</h2>

<img class="example" src="images/example1.png" alt="Example of getElementsByTagName">

<p class="caption">Above: An example of <code>.getElementsByTagName( );</code> &mdash; note that the <code>h2</code> elements obtained are put into an array. We access the items in the array with the usual JavaScript array methods.</p>

<img class="example" src="images/example2.png" alt="Example of getElementById">

<p class="caption">Above: An example of <code>.getElementById( );</code> &mdash; note that only one element can have a particular <code>id</code>, so this is not an array. The element with <code>id="Rama"</code> happens to be an image. We are able to get the value of its <code>src</code> attribute.</p>

<img class="example" src="images/example3.png" alt="Example of getElementsByClassName">

<p class="caption">Above: An example of <code>.getElementsByClassName( );</code> &mdash; note that the elements obtained are put into an array. All of these are <code>img</code> elements, and we are able to get the value of their <code>alt</code> attributes.</p>

<img class="example" src="images/example4.png" alt="Example 2 of getElementsByClassName">

<p class="caption">Above: Another example of <code>.getElementsByClassName( );</code> &mdash; compare with the previous example. All the elements with <code>class="special"</code> are SPANs enclosing phrases within the paragraphs.</p>
