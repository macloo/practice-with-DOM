# Practice with JavaScript methods and the DOM

This very small repo contains a simple HTML page with headings, paragraphs and images. Various `id` and `class` attributes have been inserted to facilitate practicing in the JavaScript Console in Chrome for beginners.

![getElementsByTagName](images/example1.png)

![getElementById](images/example1.png)

![getElementsByClassName](images/example1.png)

![getElementsByClassName](images/example1.png)

## How to use the practice page

1. Open the page in Chrome.

2. Open the JavaScript Console.
